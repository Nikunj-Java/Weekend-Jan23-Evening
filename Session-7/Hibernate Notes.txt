What is Hibernate?
--------------------------
- Hibernate is a java framework that simplifies the developement of JAVA Application for communication With Database

- It is OPEN SOURCE , LIGHT WEIGHT, ORM(OBJECT RELATIONAL MAPPING)
- It implememnts the specification of JPA(Java Percistance API)


What is ORM Tool?
--------------------------
- an ORM tool is used for data creation, data manipulation, Data Access
- it is a programming technique that maps the object for data to store in the database
- basically it uses JDBC API to interact with Database


What is JPA?
--------------------------

- java percistance API provides creation fucntion and standard to ORM tool
-it is available in 'javax.percistance' package having classes and interfaces


ADAVANTAGES :
---------------------------

1. open source and light weight
2. Fast performance (cache are used internally)
3. Database Independent Query (HQL- it is object oriented version of SQL, the full form is Hibernate Query Language)
4. Automaticaly Creates the Table
5. Simplifies Complex Join in Database
6. Provides Query ststistics and Database Status


What is HQL?
----------------------------
- it is same as SQL (structured Query Language) but it doesn't depends upon the table of database
- instead of table name we use class name in HQL
- so that it is database independednt query language.


ADVANTAGES OF HQL:
---------------------------

- IT IS DATABASE INDEPENDENT
- IT SUPPORTS POLYMORPHIC QUERIES
- IT ISEASY TO LERAN FOR JAVA DEVELOPER
